Deepwoken Build Generator is a C++ program that creates randomized builds for the Roblox game Deepwoken. As of now, there are 5 options that are generated: Attunment, Oath, Weapon, Murmur, and Outfit. All builds created by this program are possible to make in-game as of 8/27/23  (e.g. You won't be able to get Silentheart with a Hero Blade). If you have questions, concerns, or feedback, don't hesitate to message me on Discord. Also, please credit me if you use this program in a YouTube video for example.
